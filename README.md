# cmontiers_code
This is a repository for the program skeleton I am creating for cmontiers and his commissioned game

The code contained in the project is simply a placeholder and is in no way complete. The goal of this code is to allow you to take the project further, and serve as an outline for you to follow when creating your prototype. The code also doesn't contain information about all of the planned features, but simply a very basic outline for your game for you to test your ideas and show to potential publishers as a proof of concept.
