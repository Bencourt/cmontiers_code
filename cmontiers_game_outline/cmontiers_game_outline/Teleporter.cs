         * and boxes.
         * 
         * The teleporter should have a collision method that checks if it has come into contact with any of the objects in
         * the level. If it has, the teleporter should then relocate the object to the chosen location in the level. If you
         * are planning on having teleporters be connected to each other, include logic to make sure the teleporter will only 
         * teleport once and not cause an infinite teleportation loop.
